## Background: CISAC’s Mission and Global Role

The *Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d’Auteurs et Compositeurs* (CISAC) is an international non-profit organization that represents authors’ societies (also known as collective management organizations, or CMOs) worldwide. CISAC’s mission is to **protect the rights and promote the interests of creators** across all regions and artistic repertoires, and to enable collective management organizations to seamlessly represent creators internationally. In practice, CISAC supports its member societies’ licensing and royalty collections, works to ensure fair remuneration for creators, and serves as a global center of knowledge and expertise for authors’ societies. CISAC also acts as a united voice for creators in policy debates, advocating for strong legal protection of copyright and authors’ rights on the world stage. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

Founded in 1926, CISAC has grown into *the world’s largest network of authors’ societies*. As of 2024, it comprises **225 member societies across 116 countries**, collectively representing over **5 million creators and publishers** in music, audiovisual, drama, visual arts, and literature. CISAC is headquartered in France with regional offices in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific, reflecting its global footprint. The Confederation’s governance includes an annual General Assembly of member societies and an elected Board of Directors, which allows CISAC to set professional rules and high standards for its members. This organizational structure enables CISAC to coordinate its diverse member societies and implement collective strategies – from business and IT tools to legal frameworks – that help ensure royalties flow to authors for the use of their works anywhere in the world. In summary, CISAC serves as a **hub of the international creative network**, providing global leadership, advocacy, and services to strengthen the system of collective rights management on behalf of creators. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

## The International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC): Purpose and Format

The **International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC)** is a standardized identifier used to uniquely tag musical works (songs, compositions) on a global scale. Developed under CISAC’s guidance in the late 1990s and adopted as an ISO standard in 2001 (ISO 15707), the ISWC was designed to address the need for reliable identification of musical works in the digital age. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)] Its core purpose is to provide a **unique, permanent, internationally recognized reference number** for each musical work, enabling consistent identification across databases and national borders. By assigning a unique code to every composition, the ISWC system benefits all key participants in the music value chain – composers, songwriters, publishers, collective societies, digital service providers, etc. – by standardizing work data and making the administration of rights and distribution of royalties more efficient worldwide. In essence, the ISWC serves as a common “language” for musical works metadata, helping link each song to its creators so that usage can be tracked and authors can be properly credited and paid. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)]

**Format:** An ISWC is an 11-character alphanumeric code with a fixed structure. It consists of a prefix letter “T”, followed by a 9-digit work identifier, and ending with a single check digit for error detection. When written in print, the code is usually preceded by the letters “ISWC”, and often formatted with separators for readability. For example, a valid ISWC is denoted as **ISWC T-034.524.680-1**, where “T” indicates a musical work, “034524680” is the unique work number, and “1” is the check digit. This code is assigned **only once per distinct musical work** and remains permanently associated with that work throughout its lifetime. Importantly, the ISWC identifies the musical *work* as an abstract creation (music and lyrics), independent of any specific recordings or publications of the work. In other words, it **does not cover sound recordings**, videos, or other manifestations – those are identified by other standards (for instance, the International Standard Recording Code **ISRC** is used for individual sound recordings) [[13](#source-13)]. By focusing on the underlying composition, the ISWC provides a stable identifier that transcends changes in recordings, releases, or licensing agreements. It also does *not* encode ownership or royalty split information, which can change over time; rather, it simply serves as a reference link to which rights-holder data can be attached in databases. In summary, the ISWC’s standardized format and scope make it an essential tool to unambiguously identify musical works across different countries, languages, and information systems, reducing confusion (e.g. multiple songs with the same title) and supporting a wide range of applications from song registration to usage tracking and royalty distribution. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)]

## ISWC Assignment and Registration Mechanism

**How ISWCs are assigned:** CISAC oversees a global system of ISWC assignment through authorized partner agencies. An ISWC is allocated to a musical work when that work is registered with a recognized **ISWC Registration Agency**, typically a CISAC member society (performing rights organization or other authors’ society) or authorized rights management entity in a given country. These agencies are formally appointed by the ISWC Registration Authority under CISAC’s auspices, and at present only CISAC member societies (full or provisional members) or CISAC-approved rights management entities can act as ISWC registration agencies. This policy ensures a controlled and consistent assignment process globally. When a composer, songwriter, or publisher submits a new musical work for registration to their local society, that society (as an ISWC agency) gathers the necessary documentation about the work and triggers the allocation of an ISWC via the international system. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)]

**Metadata requirements:** A key governance rule is that an ISWC will **only be issued once certain minimum metadata is complete and validated**. In particular, *all creators of the work must be uniquely identified* (typically via their international IPI numbers and role codes) before an ISWC can be generated. The registration must include at least one official title of the work, the names of all composers, lyricists, arrangers, or other creators (linked to their unique identifiers), and an indication of any relationships to existing works (such as if it’s an arrangement or part of a larger work). Without this core information – **title, creators, and their IDs** – an ISWC will not be assigned, ensuring that each code unambiguously references a distinct musical work with known authorship. The requirement to identify creators by IPI (Interested Parties Information) number is crucial; the IPI system, also coordinated via CISAC, provides a unique international code for songwriters, composers, and publishers, allowing the ISWC database to link works to the correct contributors regardless of name variations. [[9](#source-9)] Additionally, at least one of the listed creators should be affiliated with the registering agency (i.e. a member of that society) to authorize the assignment. Once the society has verified the work’s details and contributors, it submits the data to the central ISWC system. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)][[9](#source-9)]

**Centralized allocation:** Historically, ISWCs were issued in a distributed manner, but a major upgrade in 2020 introduced a **fully centralized assignment system** operated by CISAC. [[4](#source-4)] Now, when a member society (agency) registers a work, the request goes to the central ISWC database and a new ISWC code is assigned in real time from a single global sequence (ensuring no duplicates). The local agency still handles the documentation and initial data entry (interfacing with the songwriters and publishers), but the code generation and tracking of issued ISWCs are managed centrally for consistency. This centralized approach also enables **faster turnaround** – the upgraded system can typically allocate a new ISWC within hours of a complete registration, as opposed to days or weeks in the past. Once generated, the ISWC is communicated back to the registering society and is disseminated to other databases as needed (for example, shared with other societies via CIS-Net [[7](#source-7)], or made available to publishers and digital services). The ISWC should then be used in all further communications about that work: it is often printed on cue sheets, documentation, and in digital metadata accompanying the work, to facilitate accurate identification. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[4](#source-4)][[7](#source-7)]

**Publisher and third-party services:** In recent years, CISAC has introduced new tools to integrate ISWC assignment earlier in the music creation and release process. One such initiative is the **ISWC Allocation Service (IAS)** for music publishers. This service allows a publisher to directly obtain an ISWC for a new work *as soon as the full metadata is known*, even **before** the work is formally registered with a CMO or added to a society’s database. [[16](#source-16)] In practice, a music publisher who has all the song details (title, writers and their IPI numbers, etc.) can use the IAS via an API to get the ISWC immediately, ensuring the code is in place from the outset. This is particularly useful to align the timing of ISWC issuance with the commercial release of music (so that the composition’s ISWC can accompany the recording’s release). Publishers can contact their society or CISAC to gain access to this service, which operates through CISAC’s central system. Another tool is the **ISWC Resolution Service (IRS)** for publishers. The IRS is a lookup and matching service provided centrally by CISAC that lets publishers compare their own song catalog data against the ISWC database – it helps them find ISWC codes for works in their repertoire, validate existing codes, or discover if a code has been merged or corrected. [[17](#source-17)] For example, a publisher can submit a batch of song titles and writer information from their catalog and retrieve the corresponding ISWCs from the global system, greatly improving the coverage of ISWCs in their records. These services underscore CISAC’s commitment to extending the ISWC’s utility beyond the societies to other stakeholders in the industry. [[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

## CISAC’s Role in ISWC Administration and Governance

CISAC plays a central **administrative and governance role** in the ISWC system, in line with its broader mission to improve global data coordination for creative works. In practical terms, CISAC acts as the **administrator and registration authority** for the ISWC standard. This means CISAC is responsible for maintaining the **technical infrastructure** that underpins ISWC issuance, setting the policies and standards for its use, and coordinating the participation of member societies and other entities in the system. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

On the **technical side**, CISAC manages the **central ISWC database and allocation platform**. The ISWC system is part of CISAC’s suite of information services (often referred to as the Common Information System), which interconnect member societies’ databases and facilitate data exchange. CISAC ensures that the central ISWC registry is continuously updated and accessible to stakeholders. In 2020, CISAC completed a major modernization of the ISWC system to improve its speed, accuracy, and scalability. [[4](#source-4)] This overhaul was carried out with expert technology partners and involved migrating the system to modern cloud-based architecture with enhanced matching algorithms. As a result, the process of assigning ISWCs became highly efficient – codes are now typically issued within hours of registration – and data quality controls were strengthened (for instance, the new system can automatically detect and merge duplicate work entries or flag potential conflicts). CISAC also provides **tools and interfaces** for different users to interact with the ISWC data: for example, the *ISWC-Net* online portal is a public search tool to look up musical works and their ISWC codes, made available as an extension of CISAC’s CIS-Net network. [[7](#source-7)] Furthermore, CISAC has developed APIs and web services (as mentioned earlier) that allow member societies, publishers, and digital services to integrate directly with the ISWC database for bulk queries or automated registration. By hosting and maintaining these central systems, CISAC ensures that the ISWC remains a reliable and up-to-date identifier globally. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[4](#source-4)][[7](#source-7)][[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

On the **administrative and governance side**, CISAC sets the **rules and standards** that govern ISWC assignment and usage. Since ISWC is an ISO standard, there are formal rules (documented in ISO 15707) for its structure and issuance. [[3](#source-3)] CISAC, in its role, works in line with these ISO rules and often collaborates with the International Organization for Standardization to update or refine the standard as needed. (Notably, the ISWC standard was reaffirmed in 2022, indicating ongoing governance attention to keep it current.) Within the CISAC framework, **only approved member societies or partners can act as ISWC agencies**, and they must follow **ISWC business rules** set by CISAC’s governing bodies. [[8](#source-8)] CISAC’s **Binding Resolutions** for its member societies explicitly mandate the adoption of international identifiers like the ISWC and IPI in their operations. In fact, since 2010–2011, CISAC has required all member music societies to use the ISWC for documenting works, as part of a broader effort to standardize data exchanges and improve the accuracy of royalty distributions. [[8](#source-8)] Compliance with these rules is monitored, and CISAC provides support and training to societies to help implement the standards. The organization’s technical committees and working groups serve as forums to continually refine the ISWC system’s procedures (for example, addressing edge cases in work registrations, improving matching logic, etc.). Thus, CISAC functions as the **guardian of the ISWC system’s integrity** – it appoints and oversees the registration agencies, ensures that each agency has access to the necessary tools, and that they adhere to the standardized practices when allocating codes. [[8](#source-8)][[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)]

In addition, CISAC has taken steps to consolidate control over key data infrastructure to improve agility and governance. In 2023, CISAC completed the **takeover of CIS-Net** (the global network for inter-society data exchange which underlies systems like ISWC) from a third-party consortium, bringing it under direct CISAC management. [[7](#source-7)] This move allows CISAC to more rapidly adapt and upgrade the interconnected systems to meet societies’ changing needs. Overall, CISAC’s dual role – as a **standard-setter** (defining how ISWC is used and ensuring compliance) and as a **service provider** (running the central database and technical services) – positions it at the heart of ISWC administration. The organization not only issues the codes but also fosters an ecosystem where the ISWC is effectively implemented and trusted as *the* authoritative identifier for musical works globally. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[7](#source-7)]

## Governance Policies, Data Standards and Interoperability

**Governance and policies:** The governance of the ISWC system is tightly linked to CISAC’s broader professional standards for member societies. CISAC uses tools like Professional Rules and Binding Resolutions to enforce best practices: for example, societies are required to document musical works using international identification standards – notably the ISWC for works and the IPI for interested parties – to ensure prompt and accurate identification of rights holders and works across borders. [[8](#source-8)] By making ISWC adoption compulsory within its network, CISAC has effectively globalized the code. Each ISWC registration agency must abide by common **business rules** (derived from the ISO standard and CISAC guidelines) that dictate how codes are allocated and how work data is managed. These rules cover aspects such as the metadata prerequisites for assignment (discussed earlier), avoiding duplication (one work gets only one ISWC in the system), handling revisions or splits of works, and timely sharing of ISWC data with the international database. CISAC’s Secretariat and technical committees provide oversight – if conflicts or data quality issues arise (for instance, two agencies inadvertently register the same work under different titles), there are mechanisms to reconcile and, if needed, **merge or correct ISWC entries** to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between works and codes. The ISWC Registration Authority (operated through CISAC) has the final say on authorizing agencies and can revoke or grant agency status as needed, thereby controlling who is permitted to issue ISWCs. All these governance measures ensure that the ISWC system runs uniformly and that stakeholders can trust the code’s uniqueness and accuracy. [[8](#source-8)][[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)]

**Data standards and quality:** As part of its stewardship, CISAC emphasizes rigorous data standards for ISWC records. The ISWC is an **ISO-certified standard**, which means its format and issuance principles are internationally agreed upon. [[3](#source-3)] The descriptive metadata associated with each ISWC (titles, creators, etc.) follows standardized coding schemes. For example, creator roles (composer, author, arranger, etc.) are encoded using standard role codes, and relationships like “derived from” or “medley” are indicated with specific derivation codes. CISAC’s system also leverages the **Interested Parties Information (IPI) system** for contributor identification. The IPI database, which CISAC helps maintain, assigns a unique numeric identifier to each songwriter, composer, and music publisher worldwide. [[9](#source-9)] By including the IPI numbers of all creators in an ISWC registration, the system achieves unambiguous identification of the parties involved in a work. This interoperability between ISWC and IPI is crucial – it links the work record to the authoritative registry of rights owners. For example, two songwriters named John Smith will each have distinct IPI codes, so if both write different songs, the ISWC records will reflect exactly which “John Smith” is attached to each work, eliminating confusion. Data standards like these improve matching accuracy when societies exchange information and when royalties are allocated. [[9](#source-9)][[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)]

CISAC has also been active in aligning ISWC data standards with other industry initiatives. It collaborates with organizations such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and industry groups on developing **common data exchange formats**. [[15](#source-15)] One notable effort is the promotion of the **CWR (Common Works Registration)** format (developed via partnership with publishers and societies) for submitting musical works data, which includes fields for ISWC and IPI and thus embeds these standards into ordinary data flows. Additionally, CISAC participates in or supports the **DDEX** standards (Digital Data Exchange, used in the record industry) to ensure that metadata flowing from record labels and digital services can carry ISWC information in a compatible way. [[12](#source-12)] All these measures underscore a governance philosophy of **interoperability** – the ISWC is not an isolated code, but part of a network of identifiers and data systems that work in concert. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)][[12](#source-12)][[15](#source-15)]

**Interoperability with IPI, ISRC, and other systems:** The ISWC’s effectiveness greatly increases when used alongside other standard identifiers in the music industry. Two of the most important related codes are the **IPI (Interested Party Information)** code for rights holders and the **ISRC (International Standard Recording Code)** for sound recordings. [[9](#source-9)][[13](#source-13)] CISAC’s approach has been to weave the ISWC system into a broader interoperable framework:

* **IPI System:** As noted, the IPI system is a database of composers, authors, and publishers, each with a unique identifier. It is managed by a CISAC-affiliated agency and used by all major CMOs. ISWC records inherently include IPI numbers for all credited creators, meaning that any ISWC entry is automatically linked to the global identities of the people behind the work. This interoperability ensures that when a work is identified by ISWC, one can also retrieve the standardized identities of its creators (which, for instance, can be cross-referenced to contact information or society affiliations in the IPI system). The linkage between ISWC and IPI also enables cleaner royalty processing; societies can quickly recognize if the same composer is involved in different works or if a songwriter is represented under different aliases, because the IPI serves as a common key. Moreover, CISAC has coordinated the ISWC and IPI efforts under the umbrella of its Common Information System project since the 1990s. By developing these standards together, CISAC made sure that work codes and party codes complement each other. The organization has also been working with the ISO and other partners on **ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier)**, a public identifier for contributors, ensuring that ISWC (work), IPI (internal party ID), and ISNI (external party ID) can interlink where appropriate. In summary, interoperability with IPI means that ISWC is part of a *holistic data environment* for musical works: you can go from an ISWC to the involved creators, and from those creators to their affiliated societies and catalogs, seamlessly. [[9](#source-9)][[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)][[15](#source-15)]

* **ISRC and recordings:** One of the most significant interoperability initiatives in recent years has been between ISWC (musical work code) and **ISRC** (the recording code). ISRC, which is managed by the recording industry (IFPI and national ISRC agencies), identifies specific recordings or audio tracks. [[13](#source-13)] A single musical work (one ISWC) can have many recordings (each with its own ISRC) – for example, a popular song may be recorded by multiple artists or appears on many albums. Conversely, digital music services mainly index and report usage by ISRC (since they deal with recordings/files). To ensure songwriters are paid when a track is played, the ISRC reported from a streaming service must be matched to the underlying work’s ISWC in order to route royalties to the correct rights holders. CISAC recognizes this critical link and has been actively **promoting the integration of ISWC and ISRC data**. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[11](#source-11)][[13](#source-13)] The ideal scenario – which CISAC and its partners are now working toward – is that when a new song is released to the public, the recording’s ISRC and the composition’s ISWC are **paired from the outset** and delivered together to digital platforms. This would mean that when a streaming service ingests a new track into its library, it would not only know the ISRC (for the recording) but also have the ISWC (for the composition) embedded or referenced. Achieving this requires coordination between music publishers, record labels, and societies at the time of music distribution. CISAC has been encouraging such coordination through pilot programs and working groups. For instance, CISAC’s 2024 Annual Report noted the aim of **issuing ISWCs at the point of release via labels**, and delivering ISWC data to digital service providers (DSPs) in tandem with recordings. [[5](#source-5)] In 2022, an expert CISAC panel highlighted that the *“key objective now is that the ISWC is uploaded with songs to digital service providers, together with the recording information identified by its ISRC”*, to ensure accurate and frictionless identification of works in the streaming environment. [[18](#source-18)] Aligning these identifiers can greatly reduce the longstanding problem of unmatched works (where a song plays but the songwriter’s society cannot automatically recognize it due to missing work info). It will expedite licensing and royalty payouts by removing manual data reconciliation steps. Major industry players are on board: Spotify, for example, publicly supported CISAC’s ISWC/ISRC interoperability efforts, stating it is *“thrilled to soon be active participants in the ISWC dissemination initiative”* and that sharing identifiers across the ecosystem will help royalties reach songwriters faster and more accurately. [[11](#source-11)]

Beyond ISRC and IPI, the ISWC system also interacts with other databases and standards. Many collective management organizations use regional or shared databases (like ICE in Europe, or databases of sub-publishers) – those systems incorporate ISWCs as a key data point for works, enabling **data exchanges** among societies. CISAC’s CIS-Net platform is a backbone for such exchanges: it allows societies to query each other’s repertoires by title, writer, or ISWC to obtain metadata when processing licenses. [[7](#source-7)] Having a common ISWC dramatically improves the success of these searches and matches. CISAC’s recent control of CIS-Net should further enhance how ISWC data flows between societies and other partners. [[7](#source-7)] Additionally, as the industry moves toward more open data, ISWC is finding uses in emerging contexts, such as **open music databases and blockchain projects** for music rights, where it serves as the de facto identifier for works, ensuring that different systems refer to the same song with the same code. [[15](#source-15)] Interoperability is an ongoing journey, but CISAC’s stewardship of ISWC alongside complementary standards (IPI, ISRC, ISNI, etc.) is building an increasingly connected infrastructure for music rights information. [[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)][[3](#source-3)][[7](#source-7)][[9](#source-9)][[13](#source-13)][[15](#source-15)]

## Recent Developments and ISWC Implementation Initiatives

In the past few years, CISAC has undertaken significant initiatives to modernize the ISWC system and broaden its adoption across the music industry. A **major development came in 2020**, when CISAC completed a comprehensive **ISWC system upgrade** – the first overhaul of the system in decades. [[4](#source-4)] This modernization project introduced *several improvements* aimed at addressing the challenges of the digital music era:

* **Centralized and faster ISWC allocation:** The upgrade shifted all ISWC generation to a *central platform*, ensuring a consistent approach worldwide and eliminating duplicate allocations. With this centralization and new technology, the speed of assigning an ISWC was dramatically increased. What used to take days through manual or batch processes can now happen within **a few hours** of receiving a work registration, meaning new songs get their ISWCs almost in real-time. This rapid turnaround allows ISWCs to be available in time for new releases on digital services, which is crucial for linking works to recordings early in their lifecycle. [[4](#source-4)][[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

* **Improved data accuracy and maintenance:** The new ISWC system introduced more robust metadata management. It became easier to update or correct the information associated with an ISWC if errors are found. Critically, the system gained the ability to **merge multiple ISWCs** that were later discovered to refer to the same work, or to **separate entries** that were mistakenly grouped, thereby cleaning up historical inconsistencies. Agencies can also flag “suspected duplicate” works (e.g., two songs with identical titles and creators) so that they are reviewed and either confirmed as distinct or merged if they are the same. These features enhance the overall quality of the ISWC database, giving users more confidence that each code is correct and up-to-date. [[4](#source-4)][[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

* **New interfaces and services:** Alongside back-end improvements, CISAC rolled out modern APIs (application programming interfaces) to facilitate access to the ISWC system by various stakeholders. As noted, the ISWC **Allocation Service (IAS)** was introduced for publishers, allowing them to directly request ISWCs through an API before registering works with societies. [[16](#source-16)] Additionally, the ISWC **Resolution Service (IRS)** was made available, enabling bulk queries and validation of ISWCs for users like music publishers and digital services. [[17](#source-17)] These services leverage the upgraded platform and represent an effort to push ISWC integration beyond the realm of authors’ societies to the **broader music ecosystem**. [[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

After implementing the technical upgrade, CISAC’s focus shifted to **driving adoption and usage** of the ISWC throughout the industry. A key theme in 2021–2023 has been outreach and collaboration with music publishers, **DSPs (Digital Service Providers)**, and record labels to ensure the ISWC is utilized at all stages of music commercialization. CISAC convened industry panels and working groups (for example, through its Society Publisher Forum and other initiatives) to share progress and encourage stakeholder engagement. [[18](#source-18)] By late 2022, CISAC reported that **all 100+ of its member music societies worldwide had implemented the new ISWC system** in their operations – a notable achievement demonstrating full buy-in from the collective management side. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)] The next step has been to integrate publishers more deeply: many major publishing companies started using the new ISWC services, and positive results were noted. *Peermusic*, one of the world’s largest independent publishers, for instance, revealed that by using the ISWC Resolution Service they were able to retrieve **over 1.2 million ISWC codes** for works in their back-catalog that previously lacked them, after making nearly 2 million lookup requests to the system. [[14](#source-14)] This significantly increased the ISWC coverage of their repertoire, meaning a greater proportion of their songs are now tagged with the standard code and can be efficiently matched when used by digital services. Such success stories have bolstered efforts to get more publishers on board. [[14](#source-14)][[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

Another ongoing development is the initiative to involve **digital music platforms and distributors** in the ISWC network. In 2023–2024, CISAC began delivering ISWC data services to DSPs and other data companies, enabling them to fetch ISWCs in bulk and incorporate them into their music metadata. The goal is that companies like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and others will routinely include ISWC codes in their catalogs and reporting. Some DSPs have already signaled strong support – as mentioned, Spotify expects to be an active participant in ISWC dissemination efforts. [[11](#source-11)] This development goes hand-in-hand with label involvement: CISAC is working with record labels so that when a label registers a new track (usually getting an ISRC for it), they either obtain the corresponding ISWC from the publisher or allocate one via the new tools, thereby *embedding the ISWC at the point of release*. If this practice becomes standard, it would be a breakthrough for the industry: every new song release would carry the ISWC and ISRC together, greatly streamlining downstream processes like royalty matching and licensing. In effect, CISAC’s recent initiatives aim to move the ISWC from being a back-office tool used by societies to a **front-line identifier** visible and used by all parties when a song is distributed and played. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[11](#source-11)][[13](#source-13)][[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

CISAC also continues to refine the system itself. There are ongoing enhancements in collaboration with tech partners – for example, improving the matching algorithms that suggest possible duplicate works or linking ISWCs with ISRCs based on metadata heuristics. Given the fast growth of music data (tens of millions of works and recordings in circulation), scalability remains a focus. The organization’s annual reports and updates have highlighted ISWC improvement as a strategic priority. In the 2024 Annual Report, CISAC noted that after the 2020 upgrade’s success, it is *“continuing to increase adoption of the ISWC”* by rolling out new services to publishers and **developing allocation via labels**, as well as providing ISWC access to more digital and data services. [[5](#source-5)] This demonstrates a clear roadmap: **universality** of ISWC usage is the end goal. Recent years have thus seen a transformation of the ISWC framework from a niche, back-end identifier used mainly among societies into a modern, widely integrated system that could underpin the entire digital music licensing supply chain. Early signs (faster identification of works, reduction in missing data cases, quicker payments to authors) are encouraging and point toward industry-wide benefits as these initiatives mature. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[11](#source-11)][[13](#source-13)][[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

## ISWC Adoption and Usage: Key Statistics

Since its inception, the ISWC has grown to become a cornerstone of music rights data, and its adoption can be illustrated by several key statistics: [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[14](#source-14)]

* **Number of works indexed:** As of the most recent data, over **52 million unique musical works** have been registered with an ISWC in the central database. This indicates the vast scope of the repertoire covered by the system – from historical compositions to newly released songs. The figure has steadily climbed as societies continue to assign ISWCs to both legacy works (back-catalog songs that predate the standard) and new works being created every day. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

* **Global network of agencies:** More than **50 societies worldwide act as ISWC Registration Agencies**, actively assigning ISWCs as part of their work registration processes. Initially, around 54 agencies had integrated ISWC usage, but following CISAC’s push for universal adoption, virtually all eligible music CMOs in the CISAC network are now on board. In fact, by 2022 CISAC confirmed that **100% of its member music societies (over 100 organizations)** had implemented the upgraded ISWC system and were routinely issuing or using ISWCs in their documentation. This comprehensive adoption at the society level means that the vast majority of new musical works being registered globally are now receiving ISWCs. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)]

* **Integration by publishers and others:** A growing number of **music publishers** have started to leverage ISWC services directly. For example, through CISAC’s publisher resolution service, thousands of works have been matched with codes – as noted earlier, one publisher alone added 1.2 million ISWCs to its catalog via the new system. Industry-wide, the coverage of ISWCs in major publishers’ databases is improving, which in turn increases the presence of ISWC in metadata shared with streaming services and licensing platforms. [[14](#source-14)][[16](#source-16)][[17](#source-17)]

* **Usage in digital music reporting:** While concrete statistics on ISWC usage by DSPs are still emerging, anecdotal evidence suggests an upward trend. Some digital platforms have begun including ISWC fields in their reporting formats to societies. The number of works used in digital services is enormous (in 2017, over **40 million tracks** were available on leading platforms, and that number has grown further). The ISWC codes underpin the identification of these tracks’ compositions. With trillions of music stream transactions happening annually, the ISWC’s role in automating the linkage between those usages and the correct rightsholders is increasingly critical. The expanding engagement of tech companies (like the mentioned collaboration with Spotify and others) hints that we will soon see a majority of streaming data carrying ISWCs alongside ISRCs, dramatically reducing the volume of “unmatched” performances. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[11](#source-11)][[13](#source-13)]

* **Revenue and royalties impact:** Although not a direct metric of ISWC usage, the context is that CISAC’s member societies collectively collected over **€13.1 billion in royalties in 2023** for creators, a significant portion of which comes from multi-territorial digital services. The ISWC is a behind-the-scenes factor enabling those collections: by reliably identifying works used on platforms worldwide, it helps ensure that a play in any country is recognized and attributed. As adoption improves, we expect the efficiency (and possibly the total volume) of collections to improve because fewer uses will go unidentified. [[5](#source-5)][[6](#source-6)][[10](#source-10)]

In summary, the ISWC has achieved broad penetration in the music rights management domain. Tens of millions of works carry this code, and virtually all major societies use it as a standard. The current trajectory shows that ISWC is moving toward ubiquity in the *digital music ecosystem* as well – from the databases of publishers to the data feeds of streaming services. The continued growth in these statistics will be a strong indicator of the ISWC’s success as a universal identifier, ultimately contributing to more transparent and accurate accounting for musical works globally. **CISAC’s ongoing efforts** in outreach, system enhancement, and cross-industry collaboration are likely to further boost these adoption figures in the coming years, solidifying the ISWC’s role as an essential piece of the music metadata infrastructure.
