## Impact Assessment

### Document Classification

| Classification | Files | Correction Priority | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Shared with CISAC** | `20251030-AuditStatus.md`<br/>`archive/20251124-First-Restitution-Presentation.md` | **CRITICAL** | These documents are delivered to the client. Person name accuracy is essential for professionalism and respect. |
| **Internal working docs** | `20251024-AuditStatus-Analysis.md` | **MEDIUM** | Internal reference document. Corrections improve accuracy but lower urgency. |

### Historical Accuracy vs. Corrections

**Recommendation:** ALL corrections should be made, even in archived documents.

**Rationale:**

1. **Person Name Corrections (Moïse → Moaiz):**
   - This is NOT a historical transcription accuracy issue
   - "Moïse" was a transcription ERROR from the beginning (email headers show "Moaiz")
   - Correcting to "Moaiz" reflects the person's actual name
   - Maintaining respect for individuals outweighs document version history

2. **Technical Term Corrections (Swiss API → Suisa IPI):**
   - "Swiss API" is factually incorrect
   - Source code and specifications confirm "Suisa IPI"
   - Leaving errors in archived documents perpetuates misinformation

3. **Audit Trail Considerations:**
   - Git history preserves original versions if needed
   - No compliance requirement to maintain transcription errors
   - Professional standards favor accuracy over version preservation

## Best Practices for Future Project Management Documents

### Person Name Verification

1. **Always cross-reference with email headers** before publishing status reports
2. **Maintain a verified names list** in project documentation
3. **Check spelling in meeting participant lists** from calendar invites
4. **Avoid relying on transcription** for person names without verification

**Key Contacts Verified:**

- ✅ **Moaiz Ben Dhaou** (NOT Moïse, NOT Moise) - CISAC Technical Expert
- ✅ **Curnan Reidy** (NOT Kurnan, NOT Curman) - Spanish Point Lead
- ✅ **Xiyuan Zeng** - Spanish Point Infrastructure Architect
- ✅ **Yann Lebreuilly** - CISAC Head of Programs

### Technical Term Verification

1. **Always reference source code** for API/service names
2. **Check authoritative sources** (Core Design Documents, specifications)
3. **Use glossary as pre-publication checklist** before sharing with CISAC

**Key Terms Verified:**

- ✅ **Suisa IPI** (NOT Swiss API) - SUISA's Interested Party Information API
- ✅ **Smart AIM** (NOT SmartIM) - Spanish Point framework
- ✅ **Matching Engine** (capitalized) - Spanish Point product
- ✅ **Azure Databricks** (NOT data breaks) - Azure service
- ✅ **Cosmos DB** (NOT Cosmos TV) - Azure NoSQL database

## Validation Steps

### Pre-Correction Checklist

Before applying corrections:

1. ✅ Read glossary to understand each correction's source of truth
2. ✅ Review line numbers to confirm context matches
3. ✅ Verify no additional context needed (e.g., speaker notes, citations)
4. ✅ Check for possessive forms (Moïse's → Moaiz's)

### Post-Correction Validation

After applying corrections:

1. **Markdown linting:**

   ```bash
   npx markdownlint /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/20251030-AuditStatus.md --fix
   npx markdownlint /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/archive/20251124-First-Restitution-Presentation.md --fix
   npx markdownlint /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/20251024-AuditStatus-Analysis.md --fix
   ```

2. **Verification searches:**

   ```bash
   # Verify no "Moïse" remains
   grep -r "Moïse" /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/

   # Verify no "Swiss API" remains
   grep -r "Swiss API" /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/

   # Confirm "Moaiz" is present
   grep -r "Moaiz" /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/

   # Confirm "Suisa IPI" is present
   grep -r "Suisa IPI" /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/
   ```

3. **Git diff review:**

   ```bash
   git diff /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/20251030-AuditStatus.md
   git diff /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/archive/20251124-First-Restitution-Presentation.md
   git diff /Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/project_management/20251024-AuditStatus-Analysis.md
   ```

### Expected Correction Statistics

After all corrections are applied:

- **Total "Moïse" removed:** 47 occurrences
- **Total "Moaiz" added:** 47 occurrences
- **Total "Swiss API" removed:** 2 occurrences
- **Total "Suisa IPI" added:** 2 occurrences
