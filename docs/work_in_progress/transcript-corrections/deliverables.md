# Published Deliverables - Correction List

**Document Status:** CRITICAL - These are PUBLISHED documents already delivered to CISAC
**Created:** 2025-11-13
**Source Glossary:** [glossary.md](./glossary.md)

---

## CRITICAL PRIORITY WARNING

⚠️ **These corrections affect PUBLISHED deliverables already presented to CISAC's Piloting Committee on November 24, 2025.**

The most critical issue: **36 occurrences of "Moïse" (with French accent) should be "Moaiz" (no accent)** across 5 published document files.

**Decision Required:** Should we update published deliverables and re-deliver corrected versions to CISAC?

---

## Executive Summary

### Research Methodology

1. **Read glossary** containing 21 confirmed corrections from meeting transcripts
2. **Searched all deliverable files** in `/docs/deliverables/` directory (15 markdown files)
3. **Cross-referenced each misspelling** from glossary against published documents
4. **Documented line-level occurrences** with context for precision

### Overall Statistics

- **Total deliverable files checked:** 15 files
- **Files requiring corrections:** 5 files
- **Total corrections needed:** 38 instances
- **Primary issue:** Name spelling ("Moïse" → "Moaiz")
- **Secondary issue:** Product name in diagrams ("Swiss API" → "Suisa IPI")

### Corrections by Category

| Category | Misspelling | Correct Term | Occurrences | Files Affected | Priority |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Person Name** | Moïse | Moaiz | 36 | 5 files | **CRITICAL** |
| **Product Name** | Swiss API | Suisa IPI | 2 | 1 file | **MEDIUM** |
| **TOTAL** | | | **38** | **5 unique files** | |

### Good News

The following glossary corrections are **NOT present** in deliverables:

- ✅ No "SmartIM" (correctly uses "Smart AIM" throughout)
- ✅ No "Match Engine" (correctly uses "Matching Engine")
- ✅ No "data breaks" (correctly uses "Databricks")
- ✅ No "Cosmos TV" (correctly uses "Cosmos DB")
- ✅ No "Kurnan" or "Curman" (person names not mentioned in deliverables)
- ✅ No "AgriPortal" (correctly uses "Agency Portal")
- ✅ No "waiter names" or "daily environment" transcription errors
- ✅ Azure service capitalization is correct throughout

**Conclusion:** The deliverable editing process successfully caught and corrected most glossary errors. Only **2 types of corrections** remain: person name spelling (Moaiz) and product name in diagrams (Suisa IPI).

**File:** `/Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/deliverables/first-restitution-2025-11-24/presentation/part3-technical-findings.md`
**Total corrections:** 5 (3 Moïse + 2 Swiss API)
**Priority:** HIGH (published presentation + diagram corrections)

#### Corrections Table

| Line | Context (excerpt) | Misspelling | Correction | Glossary Reference |
|------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| 15 | `SWISS[Swiss API]` (Mermaid diagram node) | Swiss API | Suisa IPI | [Product/Service Names](./glossary.md#productservice-names) |
| 81 | `│ Swiss API   │` (ASCII diagram) | Swiss API | Suisa IPI | [Product/Service Names](./glossary.md#productservice-names) |
| 471 | `needs Moïse validation` | Moïse | Moaiz | [People Names](./glossary.md#people-names) |
| 530 | `We need to validate with Moïse (CISAC's technical expert` | Moïse | Moaiz | [People Names](./glossary.md#people-names) |
| 542 | `Moïse's operational experience would provide valuable validation` | Moïse | Moaiz | [People Names](./glossary.md#people-names) |

**Notes:**

- Lines 15 and 81 are **product name corrections** (Swiss API → Suisa IPI)
  - Line 15: Mermaid diagram architecture visualization
  - Line 81: ASCII diagram fallback (in speaker notes)
- Lines 471, 530, 542 are person name corrections (Moïse → Moaiz)
- Line 542 uses possessive form "Moïse's" → should be "Moaiz's"

**Special Consideration:**

The "Swiss API" corrections are in architecture diagrams. According to the glossary:

> **Suisa IPI:** SUISA is the Swiss collecting society. The API is their IPI (Interested Party Information) service. Source code has extensive `SuisaIpi` namespace and configuration parameters.

These diagrams show external system integration. Correcting "Swiss API" → "Suisa IPI" provides technical accuracy and matches source code terminology.

## Correction Strategy & Recommendations

### Should Published Deliverables Be Updated?

#### Arguments FOR Updating

1. **Professional Accuracy**
   - Moaiz Ben Dhaou is a CISAC technical expert referenced 36 times in deliverables
   - His name appears in email headers as "Moaiz" (no accent) - this is the authoritative source
   - Using "Moïse" (French spelling with accent) is factually incorrect
   - CISAC leadership may notice the misspelling and question overall document quality

2. **Technical Precision**
   - "Swiss API" → "Suisa IPI" correction improves technical accuracy in architecture diagrams
   - Matches source code terminology (SuisaIpi namespace throughout codebase)
   - Demonstrates thoroughness in technical documentation

3. **Minimal Effort**
   - Only 38 corrections across 5 files (low effort using find/replace)
   - No structural changes required (just name spelling)
   - Markdown linting can validate corrections

4. **Low Risk**
   - Simple corrections don't change meaning or recommendations
   - No need to re-present (can share updated files quietly)
   - Version control preserves original if needed

#### Arguments AGAINST Updating

1. **Already Presented**
   - Deliverables were presented to CISAC Piloting Committee on November 24, 2025
   - No complaints or corrections requested by CISAC
   - Re-delivering may draw attention to error unnecessarily

2. **Minor Impact**
   - Name spelling doesn't affect strategic recommendations or technical findings
   - Diagram label "Swiss API" is understandable even if imprecise
   - CISAC may not have operational relationship with Moaiz (not mentioned in workshops)

3. **Version Control Complexity**
   - Creates "v1" vs "v2" deliverable versioning
   - May require communication explaining corrections
   - Could appear unprofessional to re-deliver with "corrections"

4. **Focus Elsewhere**
   - Higher priority: Meeting transcripts contain 13+ errors (source material for future work)
   - Deliverables are "read-only snapshot" - future deliverables will be correct

### Recommended Decision

**RECOMMENDATION: Update deliverables quietly without formal re-delivery announcement**

**Rationale:**

1. **Professionalism:** Moaiz's name appears 36 times. Getting it right demonstrates attention to detail.
2. **Low effort:** 38 simple corrections via find/replace (15 minutes work + validation).
3. **Future-proofing:** If CISAC references these deliverables in 6-12 months, correct spelling will be archived version.
4. **No announcement needed:** Simply update files in repository and MkDocs site. No email to CISAC required.
5. **Version control:** Git commit message documents corrections: `doc: Correct person names and product terminology in deliverables`

**Implementation Approach:**

1. Make corrections in all 5 files
2. Run `npx markdownlint docs/deliverables/**/*.md --fix` to validate
3. Commit with clear message explaining corrections
4. Update MkDocs site (if published)
5. **DO NOT send correction notice to CISAC** (unless they specifically ask)
6. If CISAC references older version, clarify: "We updated technical terminology for precision - no changes to findings or recommendations"

## Correction Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Automated Find/Replace

Use the following find/replace operations in each file:

#### Person Name Corrections

| Find (Exact Match) | Replace With | Files Affected |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| `Moïse` | `Moaiz` | All 5 files |

**Find/Replace Command (VS Code or similar):**

```regex
Find: Moïse
Replace: Moaiz
Scope: *.md files in /docs/deliverables/first-restitution-2025-11-24/
Options: Case sensitive, Whole word
```

#### Product Name Corrections (Diagrams Only)

| Find (Exact Match) | Replace With | Files Affected |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| `SWISS[Swiss API]` | `SWISS[Suisa IPI]` | part3-technical-findings.md line 15 |
| `│ Swiss API   │` | `│ Suisa IPI  │` | part3-technical-findings.md line 81 |

**Note:** Line 81 ASCII diagram formatting must preserve column alignment. Replace with exact spacing:

- Before: `│ Swiss API   │` (3 spaces after "API")
- After: `│ Suisa IPI  │` (2 spaces after "IPI")

### Step 2: Manual Verification

After automated find/replace, manually verify:

1. **Possessive forms corrected:**
   - Line 1033 (part6): `Moaiz's operational perspective` (not `Moaiz' s`)
   - Line 542 (part3): `Moaiz's operational experience` (not `Moaiz' s`)

2. **ASCII diagram alignment preserved:**
   - part3-technical-findings.md line 81: Box borders align correctly
   - part7-decision-points.md lines 457, 496, 524, 529, 563, 573: Diagram structure intact

3. **Mermaid diagram syntax valid:**
   - part3-technical-findings.md line 15: `SWISS[Suisa IPI]` renders correctly
   - part7-decision-points.md line 395: `Moaiz Meetings` Gantt chart renders

### Step 3: Linting Validation

Run markdown linting to ensure no formatting errors introduced:

```bash
npx markdownlint docs/deliverables/first-restitution-2025-11-24/**/*.md --fix
```

**Expected result:** No linting errors (or only auto-fixable whitespace issues)

### Step 4: Git Commit

Commit corrections with professional message (following project conventions):

```bash
git add docs/deliverables/first-restitution-2025-11-24/
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
doc: Correct person names and product terminology in deliverables

Updated published deliverables to fix misspellings identified in glossary:

- Moïse → Moaiz (36 occurrences across 5 files)
- Swiss API → Suisa IPI (2 occurrences in architecture diagrams)

Files updated:
- executive-summary.md (4 corrections)
- annexes/annex-d-items-verification.md (5 corrections)
- presentation/part3-technical-findings.md (5 corrections)
- presentation/part6-strategic-recommendations.md (9 corrections)
- presentation/part7-decision-points.md (15 corrections)

Reference: docs/work_in_progress/transcript-corrections/glossary.md

No changes to findings, recommendations, or strategic conclusions.

)"
```

**Note:** Following project's CLAUDE.md instruction: "Do not add Claude signatures or AI-generated attributions to commit messages"

### Step 5: Publish Updates (If Applicable)

If deliverables are published via MkDocs site:

```bash
# Rebuild MkDocs site with corrected files
mkdocs build

# Deploy to hosting (if applicable)
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## Alternative: Semi-Automated Correction Script

If corrections are performed multiple times (e.g., for future deliverables), consider this bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: correct-deliverables.sh
# Purpose: Apply glossary corrections to deliverable markdown files

DELIVERABLES_DIR="/Users/bastiengallay/Dev/clients/CISAC/docs/deliverables/first-restitution-2025-11-24"

echo "Applying glossary corrections to deliverables..."

# Person name correction (safe global replace)
find "$DELIVERABLES_DIR" -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/Moïse/Moaiz/g' {} +

echo "✓ Corrected Moïse → Moaiz"

# Product name corrections (file-specific for diagrams)
PART3="$DELIVERABLES_DIR/presentation/part3-technical-findings.md"

if [ -f "$PART3" ]; then
  # Mermaid diagram correction (line 15)
  sed -i '' 's/SWISS\[Swiss API\]/SWISS[Suisa IPI]/g' "$PART3"

  # ASCII diagram correction (line 81, preserve spacing)
  sed -i '' 's/│ Swiss API   │/│ Suisa IPI  │/g' "$PART3"

  echo "✓ Corrected Swiss API → Suisa IPI in diagrams"
else
  echo "⚠ Warning: part3-technical-findings.md not found"
fi

# Run linting validation
echo "Running markdown linting..."
npx markdownlint "$DELIVERABLES_DIR/**/*.md" --fix

echo "✅ Corrections complete. Review changes before committing."
```

**Usage:**

```bash
chmod +x correct-deliverables.sh
./correct-deliverables.sh
```

**Note:** Test on backup files first. The script uses `sed -i ''` (macOS BSD sed). For GNU sed (Linux), use `sed -i` instead.
