# Email: Source Code Package Gaps

**Date:** 2025-10-28

**Subject:** ISWC Audit - Source Code Review & Additional Materials Request

---

Dear Yann and Curnan,

Thank you for providing the ISWC source code package. We've completed our initial review and can begin architectural analysis.

## Current Package Assessment

The codebase structure is well-organized and has enabled us to start mapping components. However, we've identified gaps that will directly limit our audit depth:

**Missing Elements:**

1. **Current production version** - Package shows .NET Core 3.1; unclear if this matches production
2. **Matching Engine** - Integration code or API specifications not included
3. **CI/CD configurations** - No pipeline definitions, deployment scripts, or IaC templates
4. **Environment configurations** - No config files for dev/staging/production environments
5. **Developer documentation** - No README, setup guide, or architectural decision records
6. **Version control metadata** - Zip format lacks commit history, tags, or branching strategy

## Business Impact

These gaps specifically constrain our ability to:

- **Validate the â‚¬40K Hyperscale proposal** - Cannot assess current production environment alignment
- **Assess Matching Engine coupling** - Key vendor lock-in question remains surface-level only
- **Evaluate DevOps maturity** - Cannot validate Spanish Point's IaC implementation estimates
- **Provide cost optimization recommendations** - Missing infrastructure configuration context

## Request

**High Priority** (for November 14 first restitution):
- Current production codebase version
- CI/CD pipeline definitions (Azure DevOps YAML, ARM templates)
- Matching Engine API specs or integration code

**Medium Priority** (for November 21 final delivery):
- Environment configuration samples (credentials redacted)
- Developer documentation
- Git history or release notes

We understand IP and approval constraints. Any subset you can provide will enhance deliverable quality. We're happy to sign additional NDAs if needed.

## Timeline

- **November 12** - Deadline for materials to impact final delivery
- **November 14** - First restitution (will note limited-information analyses)
- **November 21** - Final delivery

Without these materials, our final report will explicitly identify which analyses were conducted with partial information and which recommendations are preliminary.

## Next Steps

Could we schedule a brief 15-minute alignment call this week to discuss:
1. Which materials can be made available
2. Timeline and any constraints
3. Additional approval requirements

We're continuing our analysis with available materials in parallel.

Thank you for your collaboration.

Best regards,
