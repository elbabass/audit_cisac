# Messages et Communications

**Last updated:** 2025-10-28

This section contains audit-related communications, correspondence drafts, and stakeholder messages for the CISAC ISWC System Audit project.

## Purpose

During the audit process, we maintain documentation of key communications with stakeholders including:

- CISAC (client) - Project sponsor and recipient of audit findings
- Spanish Point Technology (vendor) - Original system developer and current maintainer
- Internal team communications and planning

This documentation ensures:

- **Transparency** - Clear record of information requests and responses
- **Alignment** - Stakeholder expectations managed throughout the audit
- **Traceability** - Decisions and scope adjustments documented
- **Collaboration** - Efficient coordination between multiple parties

## Structure

### Draft Communications

[**draft/**](draft/index.md) - Draft emails and messages pending review/approval

- Email templates for stakeholder communications
- Multiple language versions (English, French)
- Format variations (formal email, instant messaging)

### Sent Communications

*(Not yet implemented - will contain copies of sent messages with dates)*

## Current Communications

### Source Code Gaps (October 28, 2025)

Three email variants addressing missing elements in the Spanish Point source code delivery:

- **[English version](draft/Email-SourceCodeGaps.md)** - Formal email to both Yann (CISAC) and Curnan (Spanish Point)
- **[French detailed version](draft/Email-SourceCodeGaps-Yann-FR.md)** - For Yann with decision framework (Option A vs B)
- **[French short version](draft/Email-SourceCodeGaps-Yann-FR-Short.md)** - Instant messaging format

**Context:** Spanish Point provided .NET Core 3.1 source code in zip format. Missing: Matching Engine code, CI/CD pipelines, environment configs, version history, and documentation. These gaps directly impact audit objectives including Hyperscale proposal validation (â‚¬40K) and vendor lock-in analysis.
