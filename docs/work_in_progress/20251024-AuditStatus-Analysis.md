# Audit Status Report - 2025-10-24

## Executive Summary

This report provides a snapshot of the ISWC audit progress, highlighting completed milestones, pending access requirements, key findings, and planned investigation areas.

---

## 1. Completed Milestones

- ‚úÖ Design documentation review
- ‚úÖ API subscription setup

---

## 2. Pending Access Requirements

### 2.1 From Spanish Point

- [ ] **Agency portal access** - Required for use case understanding
- [ ] **Source code access** - Critical for technical audit
- [ ] **Database access** - For schema and data analysis
- [ ] **CI/CD access** - To review deployment and testing processes

### 2.2 From CISAC

- [ ] **Hyperscale evolution proposal** - Architecture upgrade documentation

---

## 3. Key Findings & Observations

### 3.1 Code Access Challenges ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue:** Difficulties obtaining source code access

- Heavy internal approval process OR potential avoidance tactics
- Timeline: Estimated early next week at earliest
- **Impact:** Delays technical audit capabilities

### 3.2 Technical Complexity Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Observation:** Xiyuan acknowledged significant code complexity

- Admission of difficulties understanding the codebase
- Multiple developers have modified code over time
- No straightforward local development environment setup possible

### 3.3 Documentation Quality üìö

#### Positive Aspects ‚úÖ

- **Volume:** Extensive documentation available
- **Quality:** Generally good quality (apparent from initial review)
- **Core Design docs:** Dedicated list of essential documents for easier onboarding

#### Areas of Concern ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Outdated:** Most documents last modified during original implementation
- **No digest/summary:** No consolidated overview or quick-start guide
- **No contribution guide:** [*To confirm - Workshop 2 hypothesis*](../meetings/20251021-ISWC%20Audit%20-%20Workshop%202%20-%20Documentations%20and%20infrastructure.txt)

### 3.4 Collaboration & Communication ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Initial Experience (Negative)

- **Closed attitude** in first meeting
- Vague and complicated responses to questions
- Every access request systematically challenged

#### Recent Improvements (Positive)

- Slight improvement in subsequent workshops
- More cooperative despite ongoing code access issues

### 3.5 Onboarding Process ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Gaps Identified:**

- No defined onboarding process for new team members
- No documentation digest or quick-start guide
- No "how to contribute" guide [*To confirm - Workshop 2 hypothesis*](../meetings/20251021-ISWC%20Audit%20-%20Workshop%202%20-%20Documentations%20and%20infrastructure.txt)

### 3.6 Technical Architecture Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Tight Coupling Suspected:**

- Strong coupling between Matching Engine (ME) and ISWC applications [*To confirm - WS1 & WS2 hypotheses*](../meetings/20251020-SpanishPoint-AuditRelaunch.md)
- Proprietary ME aspects potentially embedded in ISWC code
- Contradicts specifications that suggest separation
- **Sources:** [Workshop 1](../meetings/20251020-SpanishPoint-AuditRelaunch.md), [Workshop 2](../meetings/20251021-ISWC%20Audit%20-%20Workshop%202%20-%20Documentations%20and%20infrastructure.txt)

### 3.7 Cost Insights üí∞

**Information from Yann:**

- **New environment setup:** ‚Ç¨25k + 20 person-days
- **UAT database size increase:** ‚Ç¨20k
- **Assessment:** Costs appear disproportionately high for infrastructure scaling

---

## 4. Investigation Roadmap

### 4.1 Immediate Priorities (No Source Code Required)

#### Organizational & Process

- [ ] **Maintenance organization and scope** (Contact: Yann + Moaiz)
- [ ] **Team composition and resource allocation** (Contact: Curnan)
  - How SP employee schedules are assigned to CISAC project
- [ ] **Jira organization review**
  - Request access/demo from Spanish Point
  - Review Yann's documentation

#### Self-Study Topics

- [ ] **Azure Hyperscale** - Understand proposed architecture upgrade
- [ ] **Azure Databricks** - Data processing pipeline review
- [ ] **Azure Cosmos DB** - NoSQL implementation patterns

### 4.2 When Source Code Becomes Available

#### Testing & Quality

- [ ] **Unit test investigation** - Review 9x% CI success rate claims
- [ ] **Code structure and style** - Assess maintainability and patterns

#### Architecture & Integration

- [ ] **Coupling analysis** - Evaluate dependencies and separation of concerns
- [ ] **Matching Engine interface** - API contracts and integration points
- [ ] **SPOF identification** - Database updates without queues or similar safeguards

#### Operations & Deployment

- [ ] **Batch processes and workflows** - Data processing pipelines
- [ ] **Validation mechanisms** - What gets validated and how
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Review ARM templates and deployment automation

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Escalate source code access** with Spanish Point management
2. **Schedule focused workshops** based on 4.1 priorities
3. **Self-study** Azure services (Hyperscale, Databricks, Cosmos DB)
4. **Prepare code review plan** for when access is granted
5. **Request Jira access** and schedule demo
