## Executive Summary

### Priority Distribution

| Priority | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| üî¥ Critical | 17 | 25% |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è High | 26 | 39% |
| üìù Medium | 19 | 28% |
| üí° Low | 5 | 7% |

### Top 5 Critical Concerns

1. **Security:** ASP.NET Core 3.1 EOL (Dec 2022), React 16.12.0 outdated (5+ years), Databricks runtime 11.3 LTS (4 versions behind)
2. **Vendor Lock-in:** Matching Engine SPOF, FastTrack SSO SPOF
3. **Data Safety:** Cosmos DB 8-hour backup window (vs 35 days SQL), untested disaster recovery
4. **Performance:** No circuit breakers, 80-second timeouts, reflection overhead
5. **Maintainability:** Generic error handling (_100 for all errors), complex nested logic, no automated testing

### Estimated Effort

- **Critical items:** 25-38 weeks total
- **High priority items:** 28-41 weeks total
- **Quick wins (<1 week):** 12 items

## üî¥ Critical Priority (17 items)

### TD-001: No Maximum Iteration Limit in Validation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [validation-pipeline](validation-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Infinite loop if buggy rule always sets `ToBeProcessed = true` |
| **Mitigation** | Add max iteration limit (e.g., 10) with logging |
| **Effort** | 1 day |

**Code Location:** `ValidationPipeline.cs:RunPipeline()` - `while (submissions.Any(s => s.ToBeProcessed))`

---

### TD-002: Batch Rules Not Implemented

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [validation-pipeline](validation-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Dead code, unused complexity |
| **Mitigation** | Either implement batch rules or remove `IBatchRule` support |
| **Effort** | 1 week (investigation + removal) |

**Decision Needed:** Are batch rules required for any use cases?

---

### TD-003: No Circuit Breaker Pattern for Matching Engine

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [matching-pipeline](matching-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Slow Matching Engine responses block all submissions; Timeout after 80s √ó 3 retries = 4 minutes; No graceful degradation |
| **Mitigation** | Implement circuit breaker (e.g., Polly CircuitBreakerPolicy) |
| **Effort** | 1-2 weeks |

**Recommended Configuration:**
- Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- Half-open state after 30 seconds
- Fallback to basic exact matching

---

### TD-004: Single Point of Failure - Matching Engine Vendor Dependency

|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [matching-pipeline](matching-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Matching Engine downtime = ISWC system unusable; No local matching capability; Vendor lock-in (Spanish Point proprietary algorithms) |
| **Mitigation** | Implement fallback matching strategy (basic exact matching); Cache frequently matched works; Consider alternative matching engine (Elasticsearch, Azure Cognitive Search) |
| **Effort** | 4-6 weeks (fallback implementation) |

**Strategic Consideration:** Evaluate cost/benefit of vendor independence vs maintaining vendor relationship

---

### TD-005: 80-Second Timeout Too Long for Matching Engine

| **Component** | [processing-pipeline](processing-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks), [post-matching-pipeline](post-matching-pipeline.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | If EF Core auto-commits after each operation, concurrent API requests could modify the same work data between ProcessingPipeline and PostMatchingPipeline, causing validation failures |
| **Mitigation** | Investigate actual transaction boundaries; Consider explicit `TransactionScope` if needed |
| **Effort** | 1 week (investigation + implementation if needed) |

**Investigation Questions:**
- What is the Entity Framework Core transaction scope? (Per-request? Per-operation?)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ‚è≥ Not Started |
| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [web-portals](web-portals.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Portal completely unusable if FastTrack is unavailable; No fallback; Vendor lock-in (external dependency outside CISAC control) |

| **Priority** | üî¥ Critical |
| **Component** | [databricks](databricks.md#technical-debt-and-risks) |
| **Impact** | Missing Features (AI-assisted queries, auto-optimization, Photon engine, Unity Catalog); Security Risk (unpatched vulnerabilities in Spark 3.3.x); Performance (modern runtimes have 20-40% optimization improvements); Support (vendor support for Runtime 11.3 LTS ends September 2025 - likely already expired); Cost (inefficient resource usage) |
| **Mitigation** | Escalate to CISAC management - critical security and cost issue |
| **Effort** | 2-4 weeks (notebook testing for breaking changes, regression testing) |

**Contractual Context:**
- Yann's expectation: Runtime updates should be included in annual maintenance contract
- Spanish Point's position: Offered to charge separately for runtime upgrade
- Yann's response: Rejected paid upgrade - maintenance should cover platform updates
- Current status: Upgrade "in progress" but delayed by months/years

**Action Required:** Escalate with evidence of security/cost impact
