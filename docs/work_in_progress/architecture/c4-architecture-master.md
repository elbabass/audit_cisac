# C4 Architecture Model - CISAC ISWC System

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** üöß Under Construction - Validation Phase

## Overview

This document serves as the central navigation hub for the CISAC ISWC system's C4 architecture model. The model is being rebuilt from primary sources with validation at each level to ensure audit-quality accuracy.

### What is C4?

The C4 model is a lean graphical notation technique for modeling software architecture. It consists of hierarchical diagrams at four levels:

1. **Level 1 - System Context:** Shows the system in scope and its relationships with users and other systems
2. **Level 2 - Containers:** Shows the high-level technology choices and how containers communicate
3. **Level 3 - Components:** Shows how containers are made up of components and their interactions
4. **Level 4 - Code:** Shows how a component is implemented (typically out of scope for architecture docs)

### Validation Methodology

This C4 model is being built using a **validation-first approach**:

**Primary Source:** [InfrastructureDiagram.png](../../resources/InfrastructureDiagram.png) - Authoritative Azure deployment diagram
**Secondary Sources:** [Core Design Documents](../../resources/core_design_documents/) - Functional specifications
**Tertiary Sources:** [Source Code](../../resources/source-code/ISWC/src/) - Implementation reality

Each level is researched from these sources, documented, and **validated by domain experts** before proceeding to the next level.

---

## Level 1: System Context

**Status:** üöß Under Construction

### Proposed System Boundaries

Based on preliminary analysis of InfrastructureDiagram.png and source code:

**System 1: ISWC Platform** (Main System)

- The core CISAC ISWC work registration and management platform
- Includes all application services, data processing, and storage
- Developed and maintained by Spanish Point Technologies
- Deployed in Azure West Europe

**System 2: Matching Engine** (External Vendor System)

- Work matching and search platform
- Developed and maintained by Spanish Point Technologies
- Integrated via HTTP REST API
- Shares Azure infrastructure with ISWC Platform
- Evidence: Source code shows HTTP client with external base URL

**External Systems:**

- **FastTrack SSO** - External authentication provider for agency users
- **Suisa API** - External API for Swiss society integration
- **Suisa SFTP** - External SFTP server for file exchange

### Key Findings from Validation Research

**Critical Discovery #1: Data Platform is NOT a separate system**

- Databricks, Data Factory, Cosmos DB, SQL Server, Data Lake are part of ISWC Platform
- They are deployment containers within the main system, not a separate logical system
- All accessed directly by ISWC APIs and Jobs

**Critical Discovery #2: Matching Engine is External**

- Source code proof: `BaseAddress-SpanishPointMatchingEngine` configuration
- No Matching Engine source code in repository
- ISWC APIs make HTTP calls to it as external dependency
- However, shares Azure infrastructure (same subscription, resource groups)

**Critical Discovery #3: Networking is Infrastructure**

- Virtual Network, Public IP are Azure infrastructure, not software systems
- ISWC SFTP should be a container in ISWC Platform

   - **Impact:** Cannot document ETL orchestration without pipeline definitions
   - **Possibilities:**
     - Managed in Azure Portal only (not source-controlled)?
     - Separate repository?
     - Separate infrastructure repo?
   - **Status:** ‚è≥ Awaiting investigation

### High Priority Questions

## Historical Context

### Previous Structurizr DSL (Archived)

The original C4 model at `../infra/overview/infrastructure-diagram-structurizr.dsl` has been archived as of 2025-10-29 due to significant architectural errors discovered during validation.

**Key Issues Identified:**

- Invented fictional system boundaries ("Data Platform", "Networking Infrastructure")
- Modeled Azure infrastructure as C4 containers (App Service Plan, Key Vault, Virtual Network)
- Unclear Matching Engine boundary (should be marked as external)
- Single "ISWC API" container vs. 4 API projects in source code
- Missing source code for some components (Public Portal)

**Archived File:** [infrastructure-diagram-structurizr.dsl.ARCHIVED](../infra/overview/infrastructure-diagram-structurizr.dsl.ARCHIVED)

The archived file includes detailed comments explaining each issue.

### Validation Sources

This rebuilt C4 model uses the following primary sources:

1. **[InfrastructureDiagram.png](../../resources/InfrastructureDiagram.png)** - Authoritative Azure deployment diagram
2. **[Core Design Documents](../../resources/core_design_documents/)** - Functional specifications (12 documents)
3. **[Source Code](../../resources/source-code/ISWC/src/)** - Implementation reality (25 projects)

## Incremental Documentation Workflow

For each new component to be documented:

### 1. User Selection Phase

User specifies:

```
NEXT COMPONENT: [Component Name]
PRIORITY LEVEL: [Critical/High/Medium]
SPECIFIC FOCUS: [Optional - specific aspects to emphasize]
KNOWN GAPS: [Optional - areas needing investigation]
```

### 2. Research Phase (Claude)

- Analyze design documents for specifications
- Analyze source code for implementation
- Identify integration points
- Discover technology stack
- Create preliminary component diagram
- Document open questions

### 3. User Validation Phase

- Review research findings
- Answer clarification questions
- Provide domain knowledge
- Correct assumptions

### 4. Documentation Phase (Claude)

- Create component document using standard template
- Include validated Mermaid diagrams
- Add complete source code references
- Document known gaps

### 5. Review & Approval

- User reviews final document
- ‚úÖ Approves ‚Üí Mark complete, move to next
- üîÑ Requests revisions ‚Üí Refine specific sections
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pauses ‚Üí Defer, pick different component
