Strategic Decisions Required (November 2025)

DECISION 1: Approve Knowledge Transfer Pilot Test?
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Investment: €10-20K                                     │
│ Timeline: December 2025 - February 2026 (2 months)     │
│ Risk: Very Low (non-critical feature)                  │
│                                                         │
│ OUR RECOMMENDATION: ✅ YES (High Priority)              │
│                                                         │
│ Rationale: Single most important data point for vendor │
│           independence strategy. €10-20K investment    │
│           de-risks €300-600K decision.                 │
│                                                         │
│ Action Required:                                        │
│ • Define pilot feature scope                           │
│ • Identify independent vendors to approach             │
│ • Allocate budget approval                             │
│ • Timeline: Start December 2025                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DECISION 2: Initiate Contract Renegotiation?
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Investment: Minimal (legal/negotiation time)           │
│ Timeline: December 2025 - March 2026 (parallel to pilot)│
│ Risk: Low (worst case: status quo continues)          │
│                                                         │
│ OUR RECOMMENDATION: ✅ YES (High Priority)              │
│                                                         │
│ Rationale: Use audit findings as leverage. Better     │
│           terms achievable whether CISAC stays or      │
│           switches vendors.                            │
│                                                         │
│ Priority Terms:                                         │
│ • CRITICAL: Git history, IaC templates, cost tooling  │
│ • HIGH: Performance SLAs, enhanced DoD, metrics sharing│
│ • MEDIUM: Knowledge transfer docs, ADR practice        │
│                                                         │
│ Action Required:                                        │
│ • Authorize Yann to lead negotiation                   │
│ • Define priority vs negotiable terms                  │
│ • Timeline: Initiate December 2025                     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DECISION 3: Approve Hyperscale Proposal (PSA 5499)?
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Investment: €40K migration + €1,800/month savings      │
│ Timeline: Migration ~2-3 months after approval         │
│ Risk: Medium (reserved instance = 1-year commitment)   │
│                                                         │
│ OUR RECOMMENDATION: ⚠️  HOLD Pending Validation        │
│                                                         │
│ Rationale: Bottleneck not validated. Query optimization│
│           may achieve similar results at lower cost.   │
│           Secondary priority vs governance issues.     │
│                                                         │
│ Actions BEFORE Approval:                                │
│ • Meet with Moïse (production performance data)        │
│ • Validate SQL Server bottleneck                       │
│ • Explore query optimization alternative (€5-10K)      │
│ • Decision by March 2026 with data                     │

│                                                         │
│ Rationale: Strengthens negotiating position even if    │
│           CISAC never switches. Informs long-term      │
│           strategy. Low cost for high strategic value. │
│                                                         │
│ Scope:                                                  │
│ • Identify alternative matching engine vendors         │

**Speaker Notes:**

Let's crystallize the decisions CISAC leadership must make.

**Decision 1: Approve Knowledge Transfer Pilot Test?**

**Our recommendation: ✅ YES (High Priority)**

This is the single most important investment. €10-20K to validate the €300-600K vendor switch assumption. Start December 2025.

Actions required:

- Define pilot feature (work with Yann/Moïse)
- Identify independent vendors to approach (French/European .NET shops)
- Allocate budget approval

**Decision 2: Initiate Contract Renegotiation?**

**Our recommendation: ✅ YES (High Priority)**

Use audit findings as leverage. Better terms benefit CISAC whether you stay or switch. Start December 2025, run parallel to pilot test.

Priority terms:

- CRITICAL: Git history access, IaC templates, cost correlation tooling
- HIGH: Performance SLAs, enhanced DoD, proactive metrics
- MEDIUM: Knowledge transfer docs, ADR practice

Action required: Authorize Yann to lead negotiation.

**Decision 3: Approve Hyperscale Proposal?**

**Our recommendation: ⚠️ HOLD Pending Validation**

€40K investment + reserved instance commitment requires performance justification we don't have. Validate SQL bottleneck first. Explore query optimization alternative (€5-10K).

Decision timeline: March 2026 after validation.

This is SECONDARY priority - governance and vendor strategy are more important.

**Decision 4: Research Alternative Matching Engine Vendors?**

**Our recommendation: ✅ YES (Medium Priority)**

€5-10K market research. Low cost, high strategic value. Strengthens negotiating position even if CISAC never switches.

Start January 2026.

**Decision 5: Vendor Relationship Strategy Going Forward?**

**Our recommendation: ⏸️ DEFER Until Phase 1 Complete**

Don't decide today. Wait for:

- Pilot test results (February 2026)
- Market research results (February 2026)
- Negotiation outcomes (ongoing through March 2026)

Then decide between Path A (vendor transition), Path B (improved relationship), or Path C (partial independence) with actual data.

Decision timeline: March 2026.

**Summary of Recommendations:**

- ✅ **YES:** Pilot test, contract negotiation, market research
- ⚠️ **HOLD:** Hyperscale proposal (validate first)
- ⏸️ **DEFER:** Final vendor strategy (decide with data in March 2026)

**Discussion Prompt:** Are there other decisions we haven't addressed that CISAC leadership needs to make?

**Speaker Notes:**

Let's translate strategy into action. Here's the concrete timeline for the next 4 months.

**December 2025 - Launch Phase:**

Pilot test setup is the priority. Define the feature, identify vendors, send RFPs. Simultaneously, prepare contract renegotiation - document audit findings, prioritize terms, schedule kickoff with Spanish Point.

URGENT: Escalate the pipeline test runner fix. This is blocking since November 4 - unacceptable.

**January 2026 - Execution Phase:**

Pilot vendor begins development. Monitor weekly - track questions, challenges, Spanish Point cooperation.

Start matching engine market research - who else offers music rights matching? Request proposals.

Meet with Moïse - get the operational truth about performance. User complaints, actual metrics, pain points.

First monthly cost review meeting - CISAC + Spanish Point + Finance. Review December spending, correlate with usage manually until tooling exists.

**February 2026 - Evaluation Phase:**

Pilot test completes. Feature delivered, tested, evaluated. Success? Partial? Failure?

Market research synthesized - alternatives exist? Viable? Compatible?

Hyperscale decision preparation - validate SQL bottleneck based on Moïse data and Application Insights analysis.

**March 2026 - Decision Phase:**

Leadership meeting - present Phase 1 results. Recommend Path A/B/C based on evidence, not assumptions.

Hyperscale decision - approve/reject/modify based on validation.

Phase 2 planning - execute the chosen strategy with confidence.

**Responsibilities are clear:**

CISAC leads pilot, negotiation, decisions. Spanish Point delivers fixes and cooperates. Audit team supports with analysis and advisory.

**This is a 4-month sprint to gather the data CISAC needs to make a multi-million-euro strategic decision responsibly.**

Thank You

Questions & Discussion

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

Key Contacts:

Audit Team (Teragone-Factory):
  Guillaume Jay
  Bastien Gallay

Final Report Delivery: End of November 2025

Next Meeting: TBD (Phase 1 results review - February 2026)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

Today's Key Messages:

✓ Platform is technically solid - not the problem
✓ Governance and control are the challenges
✓ Test knowledge transfer before committing to vendor switch
✓ Use audit findings as leverage for better contract terms
✓ Decide with data (March 2026), not assumptions (today)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

Open Discussion Topics:

• Which pilot feature makes most sense?
• What vendors should we approach for pilot test?
• Which contract terms are highest priority for CISAC?
• What performance issues have users actually reported?
• Timeline feasibility - can we execute Phase 1 by March 2026?
• Budget allocation - approval for pilot test and market research?
• Other concerns or questions from CISAC leadership?
```

**Speaker Notes:**

Thank you for your time and attention.

We've covered a lot of ground today - from the audit journey to technical findings to strategic recommendations. Let's open the floor for discussion.

**Key messages to remember:**

1. **The platform is technically solid.** Architecture is well-designed, code quality is reasonable, auto-scaling works. These are not the problems.

2. **Governance and control are the challenges.** The May 2024 incident, access delays, cost control gaps, transparency issues - these are organizational and relationship issues, not technical failures.

3. **Test knowledge transfer before committing.** The €10-20K pilot test is the most important investment we're recommending. It de-risks the €300-600K vendor switch decision.

4. **Use audit findings as leverage.** CISAC has negotiating power - use it. Better contract terms are achievable whether you stay or switch.

5. **Decide with data in March 2026, not assumptions today.** Run the pilot. Do the research. Gather the evidence. Then decide.

**Final deliverable:**

We'll deliver the comprehensive final audit report by end of November 2025. It will include all the details, references, and analysis supporting today's presentation.

**Next meeting:**

We propose a Phase 1 results review in February 2026 - evaluate pilot test outcomes, market research findings, and negotiation progress. At that point, we can provide updated recommendations based on actual results.

**Open discussion:**

What questions do you have? What concerns need addressing? What decisions can we help clarify?
