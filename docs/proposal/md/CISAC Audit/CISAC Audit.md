## **OUR UNDERSTANDING**

# **Context Introduction for ISWC Application RFP**

The International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) is a global identifier for musical works, managed by CISAC to ensure accurate rights management and royalty distribution. The ISWC System, central to the music industry, is undergoing a proposed modernization to enhance performance, scalability, and security by leveraging Microsoft Azure's latest technologies.

This RFP seeks a comprehensive audit and assessment of both the current ISWC application environment and the proposed upgrade, aiming to support a riskmitigated, future-ready transformation. The initiative will strengthen data integrity, operational efficiency, and stakeholder trust across the global music ecosystem. Your expertise is invited to help guide this critical modernization effort.

# **What is CISAC? OUR UNDERSTANDING**

CISAC (International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) is the world's leading network of authors' societies, representing over 5 million creators across 116 countries. Its mission is to protect creators' rights, promote their interests globally, and enable the efficient collective management of copyright.

CISAC sets professional standards, advocates for strong legal protection, and provides the technical infrastructure for international rights management. By fostering collaboration among member societies, CISAC ensures that creators are remunerated, and their works are recognized and protected worldwide.

## **OUR UNDERSTANDING**

# **Functional context**

- **Authoritative database** for allocating ISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code) identifiers
- Used by **every copyright companies in the world**
- **REST API REST** for interacting with the database from the outside
- **Search** by ID or metadata (titles, artists, etc.)
- **Reports generation**: number of database transactions and entries, musical works, etc.

# **Organisational context OUR UNDERSTANDING**

- **Critical Application:** authoritative database for ISWC world-wide
- No technical audit since 2020
- **Need for an independent evaluation** of the partner's work
- Desire to start regular audits

# **Technical issues OUR UNDERSTANDING**

- **Critical Performance**: 3-5 API transactions per seconds
- **Aging Architecture**: 4-5 years without re-evaluation
- **Strategical Evolutions**: Migration to Hyperscale, use a WAF, revisit service exposure
- **DevOps Quality**: Audit of pipelines and practices

# **Event Storming appendix**

## **Explore and understand your business domain**

The Event Storming workshop is an efficient way to build an understanding of the business domain, by involving both "who know why/what", and "who know how" things are done. This will allow our consultants to quickly upskill about the domain, as well as benefitting from internal CISAC and its partner's knowledge.

## **Build a language to think about your system**

These workshops will also help produce a common lexicon, pertinent to your business, that will be used during the whole audit and serves as a base of any future discussions about the system.

# **C4 Appendix**

**Visualize and understand software architecture with the desired level of details.**

# **Model the system at different layers**

At the start of the audit, we collaboratively model the whole system from high-level overview (context), to fine-grained details (code) as needed.

Workshops are run with owning teams, allowing them to describe the current architecture, and explicitly communicate its intent.

# **Cultivate living documentation**

Diagrams will be updated with newly uncovered information during the rest of the audit phases. The different documents produced during the initial workshops and after will be part of the deliverable.

## **Map services, actors, data flows and storages**

Draw a dataflow diagram of the system under analysis, to understand its features, interactions, and data it involves.

# **Identify risks leveraging the STRIDE model**

From attackers' perspective, hypothesize what could be exploited, and the impact it would have on the systems and the business.

# **Evaluate security controls and mitigations**

From the defenders' point of view, what do we have, or should have to mitigate such issues? What is the associated cost?

# **CLP – DEVOPS TRANSFORMATION**

Laying DevOps groundwork within one of the largest power suppliers in Asia

#### **CHALLENGE**

As one of the two main electric suppliers in Asia, China Light and Power (CLP) is responsible for powering homes, businesses and infrastructure in Kowloon and New Territories. As a direct cause of their ever-growing responsibilities—the company has a *robust market position,* but is also at risk of *rigid internal workflows*. PALO IT was approached to overhaul CLP Group IT's communication and technical workflow standards, helping the team to embrace DevOps development methodology; better handle volatility, complexity, and ambiguity; and ultimately improve vendor value streams.

#### **APPROACH**

PALO IT devised a bespoke plan for the multi-national luxury auto-maker. to deliver a range of Agile training programmes across the world. In addition to the trainings, it was also crucial throughout the project to ensure the team was building a long-term Agile community within the business itself. The strength and vision of this *Agile culture* was custom-built to develop skills, leverage the momentum of the initial transformation, and carry the team in the future.

#### **OUTCOME**

Deployment lead time during development phase dropped from an average of **12 hours** to **15 minutes**. Clearer and more open company culture, standardized technology, and a better structure for finding vendors who can fit into CLP's value streams. Put CLP on a clear path towards **CI/CD**, and laid the groundwork for a DevOps reference workflow that can be improved upon moving forward.
