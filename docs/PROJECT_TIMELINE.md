## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery (October 20 - November 1)

**Focus:** Foundation and context gathering

- Documentation review
- Access setup (source code, Azure portal, repositories)
- Initial architecture analysis
- Stakeholder interviews and workshops

### Phase 2: Investigation (November 4-15)

**Focus:** Deep technical analysis

- Deep-dives on priority areas
- Source code analysis
- Cost validation (Performance Proposition PSA5499)
- Technical debt assessment
- Vendor dependency analysis

### Phase 3: Synthesis (November 18-21)

**Focus:** Consolidation and delivery

- Consolidation of findings
- Strategic recommendations
- Final document preparation
- Presentation materials

## Scope Management

**Note:** Timeline is continuously adjusted based on:

- Weekly reviews with CISAC
- Discovery of blockers or new priorities
- Evolution of critical priorities
- Availability of resources and stakeholders

## Detailed Planning

For comprehensive audit priorities, component investigation plan, and detailed day allocations, see:

- [Investigation-Planning.md](project_management/Investigation-Planning.md) - Master audit backlog

## Critical Priorities

As documented in the investigation planning:

1. **Hyperscale proposal validation** - €40K project decision
2. **IaC & DevOps maturity assessment** - Validation of implementation estimates
3. **Matching Engine technical coupling** - Performance impact and vendor dependency
4. **Technical debt & upgrade path** - Security vulnerabilities and modernization roadmap
5. **Cost optimization opportunities** - Potential €60-120K/year savings

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from audit:

- **Contract/legal review** - Not our expertise, requires legal counsel
- **Comprehensive code quality audit** - Targeted review only on critical paths
- **Full security penetration testing** - Limited to architecture and configuration review
